   - **Example**: "Why did you choose this particular tech stack for your project?"
   - They also wanted to know if I have a passion for one specific tech stack or if I’m open to exploring other technologies.

After the HR round, there was a Group Discussion (GD) round. However, this was more of a formality, as everyone was selected. The HR even joked afterward, saying that the GD was just a prank, and congratulated us with, "Welcome to the corporate world!"

It was a light-hearted moment and a fun way to break the tension after the interviews.

Shreya and I got selected for the Customer Solution & Design role.
